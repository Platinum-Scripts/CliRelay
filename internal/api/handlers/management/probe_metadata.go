// probeMetadata is the selection scope shared by the panel's probes: the model
// test, the image console and the video console.
//
// A probe runs on exactly one picked credential and returns that credential's
// error unchanged, so a failure is the account's own answer and not the last
// step of a retry chain. Any credential of the operator's tenant may be picked.
// Channel groups control what API keys can reach. They should not block an
// operator who is checking whether a model or an account works, and before this
// the default group's excluded models did block it, with
// model_not_allowed_by_channel_group. Callers narrow the returned map further,
// for example to one channel or a pinned account.
